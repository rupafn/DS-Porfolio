# DS-Porfolio

This portfolio contains exploratory data analysis of different datasets from Kaggle or any other open source datasets.

Machine learning algorithms were used as well for predictions.

## Projects:

1. Heart failure dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis and heart failure prediction

3. Maternal-Health-Risk: 
  - Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Used PCA visualization with Python Plotly 
  - Predicted Health risk using ML Algorithms
  - Achieved 94% Maternal Risk Prediction Accuracy with Random Forest Algorithm
  
4. Facebook-status-clustering: 
  - Cluster facebook status from Pycaret dataset using KMeans
  - Did some data preprocessing like converting categorical data using One-Hot-Encoding and dropping columns not required
  - Used Plotly to interactively visualize the clusters
